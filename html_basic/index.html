      image.

    <h3>Learning HTML</h3>
    <p>
      HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, and it is used to create
      webpages.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this project, I'm learning how to create a simple but valid HTML
      document.
    </p>

    <p>
      I also learned how to push files to GitHub and validate my code online.
